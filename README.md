## Plain Text Viewer ##

*Plain Text Viewer* can open files of several gigabytes in size.
It provides out-of-the-box support for basic regexp search based on *Findstr*.
When [*Tre*](http://gnuwin32.sf.net/packages/tre.htm) is installed,
you can switch to *Agrep* instead and enjoy full regexp expressiveness
(albeit at the expense of slower execution).

*Plain Text Viewer* exists because I felt that
[*Large Text File Viewer*](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/Large-Text-File-Viewer.shtml)
was unbelievably slow given that, according to a few quick tests, .NET based
[*Log Expert*](http://www.log-expert.de/) achieves about the same file
processing speed despite the former's being a native Win32 application.

It seems appropriate to point out that my impression is that
[*Log Expert*](http://www.log-expert.de/) is an excellent choice for non-trivial
log analysis tasks, and that *Plain Text Viewer* is by no means an attempt to
create something similar.
